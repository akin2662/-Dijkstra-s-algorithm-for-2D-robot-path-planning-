# ENPM-661--Dijkstra-Algorithm
The code has been written in PyCharm IDE
You would need the following libraries:
OpenCV
Numpy
HeapQ
Time

The resolution of the output video is low because the array generated (image) is of high dimensions. You coud resize the output video dimensions, by changing the 'resize' variable factor at the top of the video. If in case you get numpy exception error, where in memory is not enough to store the array, check this link:

Input the X and Y coordinates of the start and goal node, when prompted in the Terminal
